                <p>Squid Game gets its title from the final round of the competition, in which Gi-hun and Sang-woo battle for the ultimate prize. The Squid Game itself is similar to tag, but with more complicated rules. There are two teams – the offense, who must ultimately reach a specified space at the end of the playing field, and the defense, whose job is to stop that from happening. The game was very popular in Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, when many of the main Squid Game cast of characters would have been children. Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has said in interviews that he chose the Squid Game as the final challenge and the title of the show because its inherent violence – commented on in the show by Squid Game’s Front Man – best represented the aspects of modern society that he wanted to comment on. It’s a grim way to end Squid Game, and it sends Gi-hun home with 45.6 billion won.</p>
