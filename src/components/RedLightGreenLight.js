                <p>Once Gi-hun and the other Squid Game contestants make it to the island, they start the games off with perhaps the most brutal one of all: Red Light, Green Light. Beloved on playgrounds around the world, Red Light, Green Light is known by many names, including Statues, Grandmother’s Footsteps, and, in Korea, “Mugunghwa kkochi pieotseumnida.” That name is also the song sung by the creepy killer doll in Squid Game, which roughly translates to “The Mugunghwa flower has bloomed.” Symbolically, Red Light, Green Light makes a lot of sense as the first game as it shows the contestants in truly traumatic fashion that if they step out of line even a little bit, they will die. It reinforces the theme of control that pervades the game, and it’s a sickeningly perfect game to whittle down the playing field as more than half of the Squid Game players are killed before the first round ends.</p>
