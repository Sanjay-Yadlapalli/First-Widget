                <p>The only round of Squid Game season 1 that isn’t explicitly a real-world playground game is round 5, which sees the contestants making their way across a treacherous path of glass platforms – some of which will hold their weight, and some of which will shatter. Still, the glass bridge game in Squid Game episode 7 is inspired by hopscotch and other similar hopping games, which date back centuries to ancient India and Rome. In the show, the game is used to represent how severely the competition is rigged against the players, as the Squid Game Front Man quickly turns out the lights when he sees one contestant can tell the difference between tempered and untampered glass.</p>
