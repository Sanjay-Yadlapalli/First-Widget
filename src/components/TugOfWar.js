                <p>the competition becomes team-based in a deadly game of tug of war. It’s a game with deep cultural significance in Korea, where variations of tug of war have been played in festivals and community celebrations for many years, especially in agricultural areas. Called juldarigi in Korea, tug of war type games are often played between the east and west sides of villages, with the winners supposedly earning a superior harvest that season. The winners of Squid Game’s tug of war obviously earn a different sort of good fortune. Thematically, the tug of war round begins a turn in Squid Game, making the competition directly between the players, rather than between the players and the organization. That shift sets up the factionalism and backstabbing that pervade the later episodes of the show.</p>
