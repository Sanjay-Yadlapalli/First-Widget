                <p>The second round of Squid Game sees the contestant play a game involving ppopgi, also called dalgona, Squid Game's sugary, honeycomb toffee candy that was once a popular Korean street food. Traditionally, if the person buying the dalgona managed to eat around the shape in the middle without breaking it, they would receive a second, free candy. That’s the challenge given to the players in Squid Game, but the reward for successful eating is survival, and the punishment for failure is death. The terrifying delicacy and fragility of the game are well reflective of the Squid Game players’ state of mind at the time, after seeing so many be killed during Red Light, Green Light. They, like the candy, hang delicately in the balance, with even the slightest mistake meaning their destruction.</p>
